Each segment should receive `n/k` elements, where `n` is the number of observations in the training set and `k` is the number of segments. Since the segment 0 starts at index 0 and contains `n/k` elements, it ends at index `(n/k)-1`. The segment 1 starts where the segment 0 left off, at index `(n/k)`. With `n/k` elements, the segment 1 ends at index `(n*2/k)-1`. Continuing in this fashion, we deduce that the segment `i` starts at index `(n*i/k)` and ends at `(n*(i+1)/k)-1`."
